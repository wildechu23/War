The Basics

The Objective:
War is a round based type of game meant to be played with friends. To begin a round, all players make the initial hand gesture to indicate round readiness. Once players are ready, all players gesture a hand motion, indicating their decision for the round. These include acquiring resources, attacking players, and blocking/deflecting attacks. The game is played until one player remains (or no players are left standing).

Types of “Moves”:

Neutral: 
Neutral moves are not directed at any specific player, hence the effects of the move apply to all players or no player. Note that this does not mean that you do not interact with other players. Neutral moves typically serve the purpose of either collecting resources or blocking damage. 

Ex. Charge gives the player one charge resources
Ex. Reflect redirects an enemy’s attack back at them. 


Neutral moves are not combinable unless specified. 
Ex. Charge - Reflect is an invalid move.

Attacking:

Attacking moves are always attacks directed at a specific player. This attack interacts directly with that player, and does not apply the attack to any other player.

Ex. Player A and Player D both use pew on Player B who uses block. Player C uses pew on Player A. Player B’s block is neutral and thus interacts with both players A and D (though is still overpowered and thus, player B dies). Player C’s pew still interacts with Player A, as it was directed. Player A’s pew does not counteract Player C as it was an attacking move not directed at C. Player A dies.

Attacking moves can always be combined (unless specified).
Ex. sniper-pew is a valid move

Interactions:

Attack vs. Block

If the attack’s damage is higher than the shield value of the block, the blocking player dies. Otherwise, the blocking player survives

Attack vs. Attack
The player with the higher damage defeats the player with lower damage. If they are equal, neither player is victorious and play continues.

The Set-up:

All players begin with no resources except for a pew-charge. This can be used up any time during the game. As the name implies, a pew is combined with a charge, hence the player chooses a player to attack with one damage, while simultaneously gaining a charge. This is the only way a player can attack and gain resources at the same time. The game begins when all players show the ready hand position.
