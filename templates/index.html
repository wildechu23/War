          <h2> Introduction: </h2>
          <p> 
              War was originally a round-based game in which players of our friend group would utilize hand gestures to indicate moves.
              Based on everyone's move, knowledge of the game's interactions were used to determine the outcomes and ultimately, the victors.
              However, as time has gone on and we have moved apart, such games have been difficult to continue.
              So, we have created an online version to strengthen our coding capabilities and for the ability to play regardless of distance.
          </p>
          <h2> The Objective: </h2>
          <p> 
              Each round, players will submit a move (and a target if required).
              These moves may include acquiring <span style="color:#7cfc84">resources</span>, <span style="color:#f0170c">attacking</span> players, or <span style="color:#b3bdf5">shielding/deflecting</span> attacks. 
              The game is played until one player remains or until none are left standing.
          </p>
          <h2> Types of Moves: </h2>
          <h3> Neutral:  </h3>
          <p>
              Neutral moves are not directed at any specific player, hence the effects of the move apply to all players or no player. 
              Note that this does not mean that you do not interact with other players. 
              Neutral moves typically serve the purpose of either collecting resources or shielding against damage. 
              <br>
              <br><span style="font-size: 13px" >Ex. <span style="color:#7cfc84">Charge</span> gives the player one charge resources<br>
              <br>Ex. <span style="color:#b3bdf5">Reflect</span> redirects an enemy’s attack back at them. </span><br>

              <br>Neutral moves are not combinable unless specified.<br> 
              <br><span style="font-size: 13px" >Ex. <span style="color:#7cfc84">Charge</span> - <span style="color:#b3bdf5">Reflect</span> is an invalid move.</span>
          </p>
          <h3> Attacking:  </h3>
          <p>
              Attacking moves are always attacks directed at a specific player. 
              This attack interacts directly with the targetted player, and only the targeted player.
              <br>
              <br><span style="font-size: 13px" >Ex. Player A and Player B use <span style="color:#7cfc84">Charge</span>.<br> 
              Player C uses <span style="color:#f0170c">Pew</span> on Player A. 
              Player B still lives.</span><br>
              
              <br><span style="font-size: 13px" >Ex. Player A and Player B use <span style="color:#f0170c">Pew</span> on each other. Player C uses <span style="color:#f0170c">Pew</span> on Player A. 
              <br>A and B's attacks cancel out, but Player C still defeats Player A.</span><br>
              
              <br>Attacking moves can always be combined (unless specified).
              Even though multiple weapons may be used, there may still only be one target.<br>
              <br><span style="font-size: 13px" >Ex. <span style="color:#f0170c">Sniper - Pew</span> is a valid move</span>
          </p>
          <h2> Interactions: </h2>
          <p>
          Attack vs. Block: <br>
          If the attack’s damage is higher than the shield value of the block, the blocking player dies.
          Otherwise, the blocking player survives
          <br> 
          Attack vs. Attack: <br>
          The player with the higher damage defeats the player with lower damage.
          If they are equal, neither player is victorious and play continues.
          
          </p>

          <h2> The Set-Up: </h2>
          <p>
              All players begin with no resources except for a pew-charge. 
              This can be used up any time during the game. 
              As the name implies, a pew is combined with a charge, hence the player chooses a player to attack with one damage, while simultaneously gaining a charge. 
              This is the only way a player can attack and gain resources at the same time. 
          </p>
